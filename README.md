## 📘 Developer Notes & Best Practices
- **Data Integrity**: Never use `db.session.delete()`! Always use the implemented soft-delete logic (`is_deleted = True`) to maintain business history.
- **Styling**: All global variables (colors, fonts, glass effects) are located in `static/Css/home.css`. Update the root tokens there for system-wide branding changes.
- **Exporting**: Always ensure the `static/templates/` folder exists for template-based downloads.

---

## 🔮 The Roadmap
- [ ] **Email Automation**: Automatic follow-up reminders 48h after client addition.
- [ ] **AI Project Analysis**: Predicting which leads are most likely to convert based on interaction history.
- [ ] **Mobile Native Sync**: Real-time push notifications for sales agents on the move.
